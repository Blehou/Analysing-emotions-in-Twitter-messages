# Analysing-emotions-in-Twitter-messages

The purpose of this project is to explore and analyse the emotions expressed in short messages on social networks, in particular Twitter, using the ‘Emotions’ dataset. This dataset is annotated with six fundamental emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness and surprise. The dataset can be used for a variety of analyses, such as detecting feelings, classifying emotions and exploring the linguistic structures associated with emotional states.
